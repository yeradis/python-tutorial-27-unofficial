# The Python Tutorial
*******************

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

For a description of standard objects and modules, see *The Python Standard Library*. *The Python Language Reference* gives a more formal definition of the language.  To write extensions in C or C++, read
*Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter* and *Python/C API Reference Manual*. There are also several books covering Python in depth.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in *The Python Standard Library*.

This unofficial tutorial is based on http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html , just minor modifications in order to be able to create new file types (ePub, Mobi) and better formatting.
